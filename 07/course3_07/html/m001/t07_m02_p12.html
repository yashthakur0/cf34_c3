					<p class="para-p">The valve will maintain the proper B-sump internal pressure from low power through to high power conditions. At low power conditions the pressure drop across the seventh stage orifice is large. Since the air has to flow from the small internal diameter of the orifice plate to the larger area of the fitting, only a restricted flow of air takes place into the valve housing. <br> <br>In the A-sump fitting the pressure drop across the larger orifice plate is minimal since the air flow from the larger area inside the valve housing through the relatively smaller diamerter orifice is less restricted. This causes the B-sump to vent into the valve housing and from there, into the A-sump. <br> <br>At high power conditions, the reverse takes place. The pressure drop across the seventh stage fitting is less which increases the flow of air into the housing. At the same time, the pressure drop across the A-sump orifice is larger, which restricts and reduces the flow from B-sump into A-Sump. The airflow from the seventh stage fitting is less restricted allowing the addition of higher pressure seventh stage pressure to assist in maintaining the higher pressure required in the B-sump housing.</p>
