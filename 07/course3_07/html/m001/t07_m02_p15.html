                    <p class="para-p">The valve will maintain the proper B-sump internal pressure from low power through to high power conditions. At low power conditions, the force from the reference pressure is low and the piston is pushed up by the spring and the pressure in B-sump. This results in the valve being in the open position, allowing B-sump to vent to A-sump with little restriction and due to the position of the piston, the flow of seventh stage into the valve housing is restricted.   <br><br>At high power settings, the force from the {PT 5.4} pressure increases and forces the piston down against the spring. This position now causes the piston to partially cover the A-sump vent, restricting the flow, and opens the seventh stage air supply to assist in maintaining the higher pressure that is required in the B-sump housing.</p>
