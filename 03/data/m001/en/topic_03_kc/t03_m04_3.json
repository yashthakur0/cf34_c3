              "The N2 input to the MFC is transmitted through the power takeoff assembly, which is splined to the compressor rotor, radial drive shaft, the AGB, the fuel pump and finally the coupling shaft.",

              "The outward movement is enhanced by the force of the speeder spring that is being compressed by the cam follower and the N2 throttle cam.",
              "Any movement of the flyweights positions a pilot valve in the N2 governor servo which controls the opening and closing of the metering valve."
