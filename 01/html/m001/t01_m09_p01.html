					<p class="para-p">The fan blades draw in atmospheric air which, when passed through the fan exhaust nozzle, provides the majority of thrust from the engine. The forward spinner is attached to the aft spinner which is attached to the forward face of the fan disk and prevents forward movement of the blade retaining pins. A series of balance weights are set into holes on the aft spinner that can be changed to provide for fan trim balance. Both spinners set an aerodynamic flow into the fan and core engine. The fan disk is attached to the forward face of the forward shaft by means of close tolerance bolts. The disk retains the blades through 28 retaining pins through the disk flanges. The forward shaft is splined to the low pressure turbine shaft and is retained with a locknut.</p><br>
