                        There are four components on the <span class="tooltip-pin AGB">AGB</span> that have carbon seals. These seals prevent oil leakage from the <span class="tooltip-pin AGB">AGB</span> through the drive shafts on the axis. They are:</p>

The leaking seal can be isolated by opening the leak detection ports, which are a standpipe or internal cavity on the <span class="tooltip-pin AGB">AGB</span>, and will fill with oil if that carbon seal is leaking. They are located below the fuel pump, hydraulic pump and the starter pads. Procedure has maintenance remove the leakage inspection ports in order to drain any residual oil, reinstall and accomplish the oil leakage engine run, and then reopen the ports to ensure that the correct seal has been identified.
