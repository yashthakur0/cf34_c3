					<p class="para-p">The pressure sub-system distributes the oil, under pressure to the required engine components. The oil is first drawn from the oil tank by a signal pressure element in the lube and scavenge pump and internally ported to the oil filter which is threaded into the pump housing. In the event of a clogged filter, resulting in high delta pressure across the filter, a bypass valve will open allowing the oil around the filter permitting unfiltered oil into the system. <br><br>The oil then passes through an anti-leak check valve which prevents the oil from gravity draining from the tank into the gearbox during an extended shutdown. The oil would then leave the pump housing, flowing through the fuel/oil heat exchanger where fuel is used to cool the oil. It then divides into a low pressure and a high pressure circuit. The high pressure circuit supplies oil to the B and C sump and the low pressure circuit supplies oil to accessory gear box (<span class="tooltip-pin AGB">AGB</span>) and then to the A sump. The lower pressure is achieved by the oil passing across a flow orifice located in the oil fitting as it enters the <span class="tooltip-pin AGB">AGB</span>. </p>
