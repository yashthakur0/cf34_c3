              "The electrical power is transmitted from the exciters through the two ignition leads to the igniter plugs.",

              "Each ignition exciter has an internal bleed-down circuit that allows stored energy to pass to ground when the system is running.",
              "If a spark occurs while removing the ignition lead, the cause could be the failure of the internal bleed-down circuit."
